# water-softener-minder
This project helps mind your water softener,  Not sure all it will do, but for now it will measure how much salt you have in the hopper. 

This project uses Telegram to send messages to you.  You need a Telegram user account and need to set up a bot using the "Botfather" tool. 
You need to put your user_id and the acceess token for your bot into a telegram_bot_token.secret file in telegram_if directory.  The telegram_bot_token.secret.example 
can be used as a template. Make sure you keep the actual data secret - don't upload it to github, etc.
